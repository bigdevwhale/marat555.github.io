What if building good habits felt like playing a game?  
Over the past months, I‚Äôve built a system that *gamifies self-discipline* ‚Äî and it works.

{% include figure.html path=page.thumbnail_path %}

Inspired by RPG mechanics and grounded in daily self-work, my habit and reward tracker in Google Sheets has become the cornerstone of my routine. This post dives into how it works, why it helps, and how you can use it to build yours.

## Why I Needed a Reward System

Like many of us, I‚Äôve always juggled multiple self-improvement goals: fitness, deep work, creativity, and mindfulness. I was consistent, but it often felt like a grind. There was no immediate dopamine hit, no feedback loop. I wanted a system that would:

- Reward consistency
- Make progress tangible
- Let me enjoy life guilt-free (hello, beer üëÄ)
- Turn self-discipline into a game

So I built it.

## How It Works

{% include figure.html path="blog/habit-reward-system/sheet-overview.png" %}

The system is simple, but powerful:

- You earn points by completing key daily habits.
- You can spend points on "rewards" (beer, Netflix, games, cheat meals, etc.).
- There‚Äôs a **weekly scoreboard**, stats dashboard, and total balance.
- It‚Äôs all powered by **Google Sheets**, so it‚Äôs easy to modify.

Let me break it down.

## Daily Habits = Points

Each habit I want to reinforce has a point value:

| Habit                          | Points |
|-------------------------------|--------|
| Workout                       | 3      |
| Wim Hof Breathing             | 2      |
| Study documentation           | 2      |
| Code on my project            | 3      |
| Learn music production        | 2      |
| Write music                   | 3      |
| Duolingo                      | 1      |
| Listen to a new album         | 1      |
| No food/sweets after 6 PM     | 3      |
| Meditation & affirmations     | 2      |
| Pomodoro work blocks          | 2      |

Every day, I mark ‚úÖ or ‚ùå for each habit. The sheet adds up the points automatically.

## Rewards = Spendable Joy

When I want to relax, I check how many points I have and ‚Äúspend‚Äù them on a reward:

| Reward                        | Cost (points) |
|------------------------------|---------------|
| Watch a movie                | 10            |
| One episode of a show        | 6             |
| 1 hour of video games        | 7             |
| 2 hours of games             | 14            |
| A beer                       | 10            |
| Cheat meal                   | 15            |
| Music break (just listening) | 3             |
| Coffee outside               | 4             |
| Offline walk (no phone)      | 3             |
| Hot bath + music             | 10            |
| Ordering food                | 18            |
| Half-day off                 | 18            |
| Social meetup                | 12            |
| Buy something small          | 20            |
| Hobby upgrade                | 25            |
| Major reward (gadget, etc.)  | 50‚Äì100        |

No guilt. If I‚Äôve earned it, I‚Äôve earned it.

## The Weekly Dashboard

{% include figure.html path="blog/habit-reward-system/weekly-dashboard.png" %}

This is where it gets interesting:

- I see how many points I earned each week
- The average points per day
- What I spent
- What I saved

This visibility keeps me motivated and helps me spot trends. If I had a bad week, I know exactly why. If I did great ‚Äî hell yeah, I‚Äôll celebrate with a nice reward.

---

## Why It Works (for Me)

- **It‚Äôs honest.** I can‚Äôt lie to myself. Either I did the habit or I didn‚Äôt.
- **It‚Äôs visual.** I see results ‚Äî both earned and spent.
- **It‚Äôs balanced.** I can reward myself *without sabotaging my goals*.
- **It‚Äôs flexible.** Want to tweak habit values? Add new rewards? Easy.
- **It‚Äôs gamified.** It feels like leveling up in real life.

## Want to Try It?

I‚Äôd love for more people to experiment with this idea.

üí° [Here‚Äôs a blank version of the sheet you can copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zaSfL4eZLlWLyZxX_GSgkh2CbiqeN0VmNUP4h1RDL60/edit?usp=sharing)

## Final Thoughts

This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúsystem that will change your life.‚Äù  
It‚Äôs a tool ‚Äî a practical framework that helped *me* stay consistent, motivated, and balanced. It might help you too, especially if:

- You‚Äôre driven but burn out quickly
- You struggle to reward yourself without guilt
- You love structure but hate rigidity

If you give it a try or want help setting it up ‚Äî reach out. I‚Äôd love to hear how you‚Äôd make it your own.
